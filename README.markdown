# CoffeeScript Koans - koans to learn CoffeeScript #

This work is based on Ben Hall's [Javascript Koans](https://github.com/BenHall/javascript-koans), 
which in turn are based upon Edgecase's [Ruby koans](http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans). 
The goal of the Coffeescript koans is to teach you CoffeeScript programming through testing.
I'll mercilessly plagarise the original documentation as follows:

When you first run the koans, you'll be presented with a runtime error and a
stack trace indicating where the error occurred. Your goal is to make the
error go away. As you fix each error, you should learn something about the
CoffeeScript language and functional programming in general.

Your journey towards CoffeeScript enlightenment starts in the koans/AboutExpects.coffee file. 
These koans will be very simple, so don't overthink them! As you progress through
more koans, more and more CoffeeScript syntax will be introduced which will allow
you to solve more complicated problems and use more advanced techniques.

### Getting Started

If you haven't already installed CoffeeScript then follow the installation instructions on the official [CoffeeScript site](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/#installation) to get set up.

### Running the Koans from a Browser

Simply navigate to the Javascript Koans folder using a file browser, and
double click on KoansRunnner.html. Any browser will do, but for the best results Firefox or Chrome is
recommended. More stack trace information shows up for Javascript on these
browsers. The first error will be in koans/AboutExpects.coffee, fix the first test and
refresh the browser. You'll need to edit the file, and then compile it using

    coffee -c AboutExpects.coffee 

I've included a Cake buildfile so from the top-level directory you can just type:

    cake build

and it will build all of the .coffee files in the koans/ directory and compile 
them to Javascript in the /lib/koans/ directory.

If you want to keep the original files intact, you can copy them to the completed-koans/ 
directory and use

    cake test

to compile them to lib/koans/

There are a number of ways that you can have .coffee files automatically
compiled to Javascript when you save them, take a look at:

*  [Your IDE e.g. IDEA](http://yeungda.github.com/coffeescript-idea/)
*  [Emacs coffee-mode](https://github.com/defunkt/coffee-mode) 
*  [Guard](https://github.com/netzpirat/guard-coffeescript)

Rinse and repeat until all tests turn green.

For this project I've used [Watchr](https://github.com/mynyml/watchr) - I've provided a koans.watchr file that 
will automatically compile files as they are saved from the koans/ directory 
to the lib/koans/ directory. 

The test runner used is [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) with a
customized report viewer.

I've also included a simple AppleScript (ChromeReloadr.sh) that will refresh the front browser window tab 
if you are using a Mac and the Chrome browser, this is currently run automatically as part of 
'cake build' or 'cake test'.

You should use the following files dependant on which OS you are running on:

* _Mac OS X:_ koans-mac.watchr
* _Linux:_ koans-linux.watchr
* _Windows:_ koans-win.watchr

The Windows and Linux versions are currently the same as the Mac version only without the 
Applescript.
